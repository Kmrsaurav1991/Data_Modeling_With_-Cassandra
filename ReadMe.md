# Data Modeling project 2 -Sparkify Cassandra ETL

# Data Engineering secound submission project

There are following two concepts:
- Data modeling with Cassandra
- ETL pipeline using Python

**Project Details

The goal of this project is to create a NoSQL analytics database in Apache Cassandra for a fictitious music streaming service called Sparkify. Sparkify's analytics team is trying to understand what, when, and how users play songs in their company's music app. Analysts need an easy way to query and analyze SongPlay data that is currently stored in a raw CSV file in a local directory.  As a data engineer assigned to the 
project, I  implemented an ETL pipeline in Python and preprocessed the data in a panda. Database tables are based on  queries based on the principle of one table per query. We chose the primary and clustering keys for each table  to ensure a unique identifier for each row.
